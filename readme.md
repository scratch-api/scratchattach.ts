# scratchattach

This is an unofficial async typescript clone of [scratchattach](https://github.com/TimMcCool/scratchattach). It is WIP!!

scratchattach is a Scratch API wrapper with support for almost all site features

[scratchattach pkg tree](https://github.com/TimMcCool/scratchattach/tree/main/scratchattach)

Note it is only loosely based on it, and will probably not provide so many abstractions

if you want a typescript version of scratchattach, i dont recommend using this.
I do not _know_ typescript, but i can _code_ it. But that does not mean my code is good.

# differences from python scratchattach

- timouts are in **milliseconds**, not seconds
- async using promises
- currently no warning message when logging in

Should these be changed? Make an issue on github if you think so.
