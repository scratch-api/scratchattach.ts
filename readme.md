# scratchattach

The official python version is available [here.](https://github.com/TimMcCool/scratchattach)

npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/scratchattach.ts
source: https://github.com/scratch-api/scratchattach.ts/

This typescript clone is far from feature complete.

scratchattach is a Scratch API wrapper with support for almost all site features

[scratchattach pkg tree](https://github.com/TimMcCool/scratchattach/tree/main/scratchattach)

Note it is only loosely based on it, and will probably not provide so many abstractions

if you want a typescript version of scratchattach, i dont recommend using this.
I do not _know_ typescript, but i can _code_ it. But that does not mean my code is good.

# differences from python scratchattach

- timouts are in **milliseconds**, not seconds
- async using promises
- currently no warning message when logging in
- uses the `master` branch instead of `main`

Should these be changed? Make an issue on github if you think so.
